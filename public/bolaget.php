            <p>Our legendary bartender, E-Type, runs the place with the same confidence
                he once ran through the 90s. The drink list is more diverse than his monotone singing, but the rules are stricter.</p>

            <h3>Our very own little Mis-Types</h3>

            <p>E-Type is assisted by our very own little Mis-Types. They are all orphans, which we mention not for sympathy,
                but for transparency.</p>

            <img src="/public//images/mis-types-chilling.png" alt="Mis-Types chilling in the backyard">

            <p>Raised entirely by the hotel, the Mis-Types have been carefully trained in beverage observation,
                disappointment management, and reporting procedures. Their dedication to informing guests about the
                dangers of excessive drinking is not a hobby — it is a lifestyle.</p>

                Should a guest display early signs of joy, confidence, or karaoke ambitions, the Mis-Types are
                authorized to calmly take notes and, if necessary, inform Transportstyrelsen immediately.

            <h3>Responsible Drinking with E-Type</h3>
            <p>Before serving you, E-Type will gently remind you about moderation,
                responsibility, and a few things you should probably feel guilty about.</p>

            <p>Relax — it’s all part of the experience. Enjoy responsibly.
                Preferably less than you want.</p>

            <p>You might not feel guilty about your alcohol consumption, but E-Type does. At least for what he drank in the 90s. Out of solidarity, please feel free to judge E-Type's past.</p>

            <h5>Important Notice</h5>
            <p>Bolaget operates under the principle of "frihet under ansvar" ("freedom with responsibility"). This means no one is responsible for anything, but everyone is quick to judge.

                Should a guest accidentally, intentionally, or heroically consume more beverages than recommended by common sense, social norms, or E-Type himself, Bolaget may choose to notify the Swedish Transport Agency (Transportstyrelsen).

                This information will be processed calmly, efficiently, and without drama. Any driving license involved will be handled accordingly upon your return to Sweden.

            </p>
            <p>
                We trust you to make good decisions.

                Statistically speaking, this trust is often misplaced.

                Please drink responsibly. Or at least drink with the awareness that consequences travel faster than you do.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might think "Why this restraint? Don't you want to make money from selling more drinks?". Well, no. We are funded by the Swedish government.

        <div>
            <h5>Got a specific hair type in your drink?</h5>
            <p>
                You're one of the lucky ones! Getting a type-hair, wether from E-Type himself or one of our very own little Mis-Types, is considered a sign of good luck and prosperity here in New Sweden.
